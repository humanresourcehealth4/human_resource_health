# Introduction

This supplementary material describes the methodological procedures, as well as documents the codes, based on R language, used for this analysis.

We adapted Asamani et al. (2021) orientations in order build a needs-based health workforce planning for Brazilian context.

Asamani et al. (2021) suggest a set of six consideration that researchers should follow when developing needs based workforce planning, which are:

1.  **Defining the scope** - defining jurisdictional coverage, health system objective and timeframe.

2.  **Analysis of the population health service needs** - population demography, health status, level of service

3.  **Translating the evidence-based service requirement into health workforce requirement** - matching health services with competent professionals, eliciting measures of productivity

4.  **Exploring resource implications** - comparing demand and supply, cost implications)

5.  **Conducting sensitivity analysis** - perform simulation according to parameter uncertainty or policy scenarios

6.  **Conducting model validation** - compare to previous experiences and stakeholder consultation

The following flowchart presents the main stages.

# Preparing R environment

Before making any progress, we need to load the R libraries that will assist performing our analysis.

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(geojsonio)
library(broom)
library(jsonlite)
library(RODBC)
library(patchwork)
library(geobr)

```

# 1 - Defining Scope

The **jurisdictional coverage** was **health regions of Goias state**. Goiás is in the middle-west of Brazil. The objective of analysis was targeted to **registered** **nurse (RN) and physician** **health workforce planning** for **pregnant** and **newborn** in the **primary healthcare (PMC)**. We employed **demand** **forecasts** for the following **two years** using artificial intelligence algorithms.

The following figure illustrates the 18 health regions of Goiás state.

![](imagens/mapa%20-%20regiões%20de%20saúde.png){fig-align="center" width="536"}

# 2 - Analysis of population health service needs

Each pregnant will require a set of services during pregnancy and after delivery according to recommendation of Brazilian Minister of Health. The same happens for the baby as soon as it is born.

![](imagens/eq1.svg){fig-align="center"}

where:

-   NHS represents Needed Health Services (NHS) which is the minimal programmatic services needed to address each the health status in a health region *r* in a given time *t*.
-   SD represents a percentage of population which dependent of Brazilian Health Unified System (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS) in a given health region *r* and *t.*
-   H represents the health status - births - for each month *t* and a region *r*.
-   L represents the number of services of type *y* required for each pregnant or baby in given time *t* before and after the child birth. The index goes from 0 to 32 because each month has programmatic services dedicated to either the pregnant woman (from t = 0 until t = 9) or the baby (from t = 9 until t = 32).

### 2.1. Health Status (H) and SUS dependent population (SD)

The following chunk shows the number of monthly births for each health region.

  geom_line() + facet_wrap(~regiao_saude, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() + xlab("Date") + ylab("SUS quantity")
  
```

### 2.2. Estimating services (L)

For each birth we quantified the number and types of procedures needed to assist pregnant women and the newborn in the primary health care (PHC) setting.

There is a technical note - produced for SUS - which describes the type and frequency of procedures women are supposed to get each month before and after child birth.

[![](imagens/nota.png){fig-align="center" width="324"}](https://www.conass.org.br/biblioteca/saude-da-mulher-na-gestacao-parto-e-puerperio/)

The number and variety of health procedures needed for each pregnant were calculated using an API developed for this project. The API reads the number of births in a given health region (variable `ibge`) according to the variable `sus_qtt` and calculates the number of procedures for previous and subsequent months for each pregnant women and newborn.

```{r include=FALSE}
#| echo: false

services <- read_excel("data/services_2025.xlsx") 

glimpse(services)

services <- services |> 
              select(ibge, regiao, data, qtd, 
                     procedimento, mes, mês_procedimento_realizado, 
                     codigo_sigtap, parametro, tipo_procedimento,
                     Público, nivel_atencao) |> 
              rename(health_region = regiao, date = data, 
                     sus_qtt = qtd, procedure = procedimento, 
                     month_performed = mês_procedimento_realizado, 
                     sigtap = codigo_sigtap, parameter = parametro, 
                     month = mes, type = tipo_procedimento, 
                     target_public = Público, 
                     level_service = nivel_atencao)

```

```{r}
#| eval: false

services <- tibble::data_frame()

for(i in 1:nrow(predictions)){
  row <- predictions[i,]
  url = paste("http://200.137.215.27:5025/calcula_procedimentos?mes_ano=", 
              substring(row$date, 1, 7), 
              "&nascidos_vivos=", 
              round(row$sus_qtt, 0), sep = '')
  temp <- fromJSON(url)
  temp$ibge <- row$ibge
  temp$regiao <- row$regiao_saude
  temp$data <- row$date
  temp$qtd <- row$sus_qtt

  
  services <- rbind(temp, services)
  
  print(paste("Chamando:",url))
}

```

This dataframe has 13 variables

```{r}
colnames(services)
```

where:

-   ibge: code that identifies each health region

-   health_region: name of the health region

-   date: date of birth

-   sus_qtt (H x SD): number of births of SUS depedent population

-   procedure (L): name of the procedure of type y

-   month: programmed month of procedure, which varies from 1 (second month of gestation) to 32 (child consultation in the 24th month of life). Zero represents the month of birth.

-   month_performed: month when procedure of type y is programmed to be performed

-   sigtap: code used by SUS to identify the procedure of type y

-   parameter: the number of procedures of type y is needed according in a given month (month)

-   type: type of procedure (consultation, vaccine, exam, delivery, educational action)

-   target_public: target audience (mother, newborn, high-risk pregnant woman)

-   level_service: level of service (primary care, secondary care)

    Since our objective is primary care, we filtered only procedures performed in this level of service.

```{r}
#| warning: false

# filter just PHC setting
phc_services <- services |> 
                filter(level_service == "APS") |> 
                filter(month <= 24) |> 
                mutate(procedure_qtt = sus_qtt * parameter) |> 
                filter(type == "Consultas ou Visitas" |
                       type == "Ações Educacionais")

glimpse(phc_services)

```

# 3 - Translating the evidence-based service requirements into health workforce requirement

According to Asamani e al. (2021), this step includes matching skills and competencies with interventions needed and eliciting workload measures. Asamani et al. (2021) uses concepts from the Workload Indicator of Staffing Needs (WISN).

### 3.1. Matching skills and competencies with interventions needed

The `phc_services` dataframe contains the `sigtap` variable. This variable represents a procedure and will be used to join with a second dataset which identifies the health professional who are able to perform the procedure.

```{r}
# loading dataframe which combines procedures and the respective professional

procedures_professional <- read_excel("~/GitHub/human_resource_health/03_hrh_model/data/calendario-procedimentos.xlsx", 
    sheet = "procedimentos_profissionais") |> 
                            select(codigo_sigtap, categoria, CBO) |> 
                            mutate(codigo_sigtap = as.numeric(codigo_sigtap)) 

```

Mackenzie et al. (2019) introduces a W parameter in the demand equation to represent the proportion of the services made by a given cadre. In our case, procedures performed by two cadres will be split equally among them. Prenatal consultation, for example, can be performed by either RN or physician, so 50% of the procedure volume will be allocated for both professionals.

```{r}
#| warning: false

# the procedure 301010080 is growth and development consultation. It is divided by 10 because the same procedure id is used for all procedure.  

qtt_professional <- 
  procedures_professional |> 
  group_by(codigo_sigtap) |> 
  count() |> 
  mutate(n = case_when(codigo_sigtap == '301010080' ~ n/10,
                       codigo_sigtap == '101010010' ~ n/2,
                       TRUE ~ n))

# In the following code:
# 1) filter for only procedures performed by nurses and physicians 
# 2) calculate the number of procedures exclusive by cadre according to the last code


professional_services <- phc_services |> 
                            left_join(qtt_professional, 
                                      by = c("sigtap" =
                                             "codigo_sigtap")) |> 
                            mutate(qtt_cadre = procedure_qtt/n) |> 
                            left_join(procedures_professional, by = c( "sigtap"="codigo_sigtap")) |> 
                            filter(categoria == "Enfermeiro" | 
                                   categoria == "Médico") |> 
                            rename(cadre = categoria)

glimpse(professional_services)

```

The new dataframe contains the variables `qtt_cadre`, `categoria` and `CBO`, where:

-   qtt_cadre: total of procedures must be executed by a professional

-   cadre: health professional that should execute that number of procedures

-   CBO: brazilian code that identifies a health professional

### 3.2. Eliciting workload measures

The next step involves defining the service standard (SS) - the average time, in hours, a trained and motivated health professional spends to perform an intervention of type y. The available working time (AWT) is the total annual time a health worker has available after deducing absences. Once we have both parameters, it is possible to calculate the service workload (SW) which is defined as a "standard workload for health professional of category n when performing service activity y" (Asamani et al., 2021, p. 7).

![](imagens/eq2.svg){fig-align="center"}

We adapted Asamani's equation for our case study but with no loss to the mathematical logic.

After including both elements, the equation 1 is complemented as below:

![](imagens/eq3.svg){fig-align="center"}

where:

-   N is the number of professionals of category *n*, in FTE40, needed in a given region *r* and period *t*.

-   R represents a percentage of population which dependent of Brazilian Health Unified System (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS) in a given health region *r* and *t.*

-   H represents the health status - births - for each month *t* and a region *r*.

-   L represents the number of services of type *y* required for each pregnant or baby in given time *t* before and after the child birth. The index goes from 1 to 32 because each month has programmatic services dedicated to either the pregnant woman or the baby.

-   SS standard time of intervetion, in hours, performed by a trained and motivated professional. We used time collected in past experiences. Using time motion techniques Bonfim et al. (2014) registered that nursing appointments took about 25,3 minutes (Brazil average) in the PHC setting. Educative actions took about 73 minutes. We will use these number as reference.

-   AWT is the available working time after deducting absence. Originally this is a metric measured in years. But we adapted it since our analysis are monthly based. We used the AWT available from Bonfim et al. (2014).

The following chunk of code translates the volume of programatic interventions into hours needed by a given professional.

```{r}
#| warning: false

demand_hours <- professional_services |> 
                mutate(month_performed = as.Date(month_performed)) |> 
                mutate(year = year(month_performed)) |> 
                filter(year == 2024) |> 
                mutate(time_needed = 
                         if_else(type == "Consultas ou Visitas",
                                        qtt_cadre * 0.66,
                                        qtt_cadre * 1.266))

glimpse(demand_hours)

```

The final step translates the number of hours in full-time equivalent (FTE) professionals. We will divide the full time required by procedures by 126 which is the total available time for each month by professional. For more information about FTE, read appendix B of this script.

```{r}
#| warning: false

prof_demand <- demand_hours |> 
        select(ibge, year, month_performed, CBO, 
               cadre, time_needed) |> 
        mutate(fte40 = time_needed/126) |> 
        group_by(ibge, month_performed, year, CBO, cadre) |> 
        summarise(total_time = sum(time_needed),
                  fte40_demand = sum(fte40),
                  fte40_demand = round(fte40_demand, 2))

glimpse(prof_demand)

```

Asamani et al (2021) incorporates a last element which is the indirect activity rate. We will apply this element on the supply side, following Mackenzie et al. (2019) steps. Furthermore, these numbers represent the total number of FTE professional needed to work in a minimal set of procedures during pregnancy and newbord assistance.

# 4 - Exploring resource implications

During this step we compared the demand for health professional, calculated in the previous stages, and the supply available in a given region.

```{r}
#| warning: false

supply <- read_csv("~/GitHub/human_resource_health/03_hrh_model/data/supply.csv")

```

We will deduce the supply considering only the workload performed to assist pregnant and newborn care.

We used a proxy number according to the volume of consultation for pregnant and newborn care in the information system for primary care (SISAB).

```{r}

sisab <- read_excel("~/GitHub/human_resource_health/03_hrh_model/data/producao_SISAB.xls") |> 
                      select(Cod_Regiao_Saude, Porcentagem)

```

## 4.1. Transforming supply data

Supply was calculated using the following equation:

![](imagens/eq4.svg){fig-align="center"}

Where:

-   S represents the net supply of professionals of type *n*, in a region *r* and a period *t*.

-   A represents the total supply of professional of type *n*, in a region *r* and a period *t* without further deduction.

-   D represents the percentage of direct activities that professional of type n usually perform

-   F represents the percentage of time dedicated to caring for pregnant women and children

Our supply dataset will eventually have duplicate values due to multiple cadre association. In order to overcome this issue, we use a standard of full time equivalent metric.

We multiply the value by four to represent the monthly workload. Next, we transform the number of hours into professional hours, dividing the value by 126 hours. In this way, if we have 3,040 hours of a professional available in a month, it would be the equivalent of having 24 professionals of 40 hours.

We also deduct the total workload dedicated to direct activities (assistance). We used as a reference 60% based on past studies.

We also deduct the percentage dedicated exclusively to activities to assist pregnant women and newborns. As previously presented, we used SISAB data to assess the volume of assistance to this public in comparison to others.

```{r}

supply_GO <- 
  supply |> 
  mutate(year_month = ym(COMPETEN)) |> 
  left_join(sisab, by = c("cod_regsaud"="Cod_Regiao_Saude")) |> 
  mutate(fte40_supply = CH/126) |> 
  mutate(direct_supply = if_else(CATEGORIA == "ENFERMEIRO",
                          fte40_supply * 0.30,
                          fte40_supply * 0.39)) |> 
  mutate(net_supply = direct_supply * Porcentagem) |>
  mutate(year_month = year_month + years(2)) |> 
  mutate(Porcentagem = round(Porcentagem, 2),
         fte40_supply = round(fte40_supply, 2),
         direct_supply = round(direct_supply, 2),
         net_supply = round(net_supply, 2)) |> 
  mutate(CATEGORIA = if_else(CATEGORIA == "ENFERMEIRO",
                             "Enfermeiro","Médico")) |> 
  select(year_month, cod_regsaud, regiao_saude,
         CATEGORIA, CH, Porcentagem, fte40_supply, 
         direct_supply, net_supply)

DT::datatable(supply_GO)

```

## 4.2. Comparing demand and supply

We will now compare demand vs supply for each health region. the `result` metric represents the subtraction between the deduced supply and the demand.

The `perc` metric represents how much supply is currently available to meet, in percentage terms, the total demand needed in the future (2024).

```{r}

monthly_demand_supply <- 
  prof_demand |>  
  left_join(supply_GO, by = c("ibge"="cod_regsaud",
                              "cadre"="CATEGORIA",                          "month_performed"="year_month")) |> 
  mutate(year = year(month_performed)) |> 
  mutate(result = net_supply - fte40_demand) |> 
  mutate(perc = (100 * net_supply)/fte40_demand)

anual_demand_supply <-
  monthly_demand_supply |> 
    group_by(ibge, regiao_saude, cadre) |> 
    summarise(
      anual_demand = sum(fte40_demand),
      anual_net_supply = sum(net_supply)) |> 
    mutate(anual_demand = round(anual_demand, 2),
           anual_net_supply = round(anual_net_supply, 2)) |> 
    mutate(abs_result = anual_net_supply - anual_demand,
           abs_result = round(abs_result, 2)) |> 
    mutate(perc_result = (100 * anual_net_supply)/anual_demand,
           perc_result = round(perc_result, 2))


DT::datatable(anual_demand_supply)

```

### 4.2.1. Demand vs Supply - Graph

```{r}

anual_demand_supply |> 
  select(-abs_result, 
         -perc_result) |> 
  gather(key = "demand_supply", 
         value = "resultado", 
         4:5) |> 
  mutate(cadre = if_else(
                    cadre == "Enfermeiro",
                             "Nurse",
                             "Physician"),
         demand_supply = if_else(
                    demand_supply == "anual_demand","Need","Supply")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(regiao_saude,

  coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~cadre) + 
  theme_minimal() + xlab("Health Region") + 
  ylab("Demand vs Supply") + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

### 4.2.2. Demand vs Supply - Map

We will now ilustrate the results, in terms of percentage, using a map.

```{r}

spdf <- geojson_read("data/shape file regioes saude.json",  what = "sp")

```

The following map illustrates the distribution of professionals by health regions and indicate that all of them have deficit of professionals, with a variation of results from 20% to 50%. In other words, the health region with the best result would need the double of the current professional to provide the minimum services.

```{r}
#| warning: false

anual_demand_supply$ibge <- as.integer(anual_demand_supply$ibge)

spdf_region <- spdf[ spdf@data$est_id == "52" , ]

                      high = "#00BA38", 
                      n.breaks = 5) +

    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  ) 
```

## 4.3. Exploring cost implication

The analysis of costs were based only on wages and salaries.

Recently, Brazil Legislative has approved the minimum wage for nursing, which represents R\$ 4.750 each month. Other costs were included, representing nearly R\$ 6.130.

Physicians do not have a legal minimun wage. The Brazilian Ministry of Work and Labour has a database that captures all monthly movements in the labour market. We analysed data from 06/2022 to 06/2023 for Goias states, which resulted in a mean monthly salary of R\$ 8.940. After adding aditional costs, this value represents R\$ 11.532,60.

Using a conversion rate of 4.90 reais (R\$) to each dollar (R\$), the values are:

| Cadre     | Annual Costs (US\$) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Nursing   | 15012.25            |
| Physician | 28241.63            |

After applying these values to our results, it is possible to capture how much should be invested in order to balance demanda and supply for human resources for health in each health region.

```{r}

cost <- 
  anual_demand_supply |> 
  mutate(abs_result = abs_result * (-1)) |> 
  mutate(cadre = if_else(cadre == "Enfermeiro",
                        "Nurse","Physician")
         ) |>

# Appendix A - FTE

FTE is a commom metric used in workforce planning and [human resources](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/hr-qa/pages/full-time-equivalent-hours.aspx#:~:text=The%20calculation%20of%20full%2Dtime,per%20week%20are%200.5%20FTEs.) studies whose objective is to standardize the number of professionals considering the workload.

Consider that, when calculating **demand**, 3200 hours of nurses are needed per month to provide all services. Translating into number of professionals, we have:

3200/126 = 25.39

In other words, given that the workload of a full-time professional - after deducting absences - is 126 hours, we would need 25 professionals for 40 hours and one professional for 16 hours (referring to 0.39).

The metric can also be used to standardize the **supply**. Considering the following table with professionals. How many nurses are there? Immediately, one can think of three nurses. However, they have different workloads. How to standardize this?

| Name             | Cadre                  | Weekly workload |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Mary             | Enfermeiro             | 35              |
| John             | Enfermeiro             | 25              |
| Suzan            | Enfermeiro             | 40              |

Nurse = 35 + 25 + 40 =\> 100 weekly hours

Nurse = 100 x 4.345 = 434.5 monthly hours

Nurse = 434.5/126 =\> 3.44 professionals in FTE-40

It can be seen that we have 3.44 full-time equivalent nursing professionals, considering a workload of 40 hours per week.
